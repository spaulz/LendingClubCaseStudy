# Lending Club Case Study
This project involves a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Lending Club dataset with the objective of uncovering insights into how various consumer and loan attributes influence the tendency of borrowers to default. 
Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform, provides a rich dataset encompassing numerous factors such as loan amounts, interest rates, employment information, credit history, and more.
The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

## General Information
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).
  The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders.
  In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
- If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- The dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
